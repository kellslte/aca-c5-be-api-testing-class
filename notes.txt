// Databases

2. Non-Relational (NoSQL Databases) -> Not Only Structured Query Language
// Method of Data Persistence
Relational (SQL) -> Tables, Rows, Columns
Non-Relational (NoSQL) -> Documents

// Types of Databases
1. Relational -> MySQL, PostgresQL, MicrosoftServerSQL etc.
2. Non-Relational -> MongoDB, CouchDB, IndexDB, CockroachDB, DockDB etc.

// MongoDB Basics
Stores data as BSON
Typical MOngoDB records are called collections.
Our typical user table in SQL will be structured like this
{
"name": "Mercy",
"username": "mercy",
"gender": "female",
"hobbies": ["reading motivational books"]
}
For a No-SQL database for instance we could have the following
{
"name": "Mercy",
"username": "mercy",
"gender": "female",
"hobbies": ["reading motivational books"]
}

{
"name": "Uche",
"username": "kingdave",
"gender": "male",
"instruments_played": ["keyboard"]
}
